Are you fascinated with Harry Potter’s Invisible Cloak?

Do you want to wear that cloak?

If Yes!! then in this python project, we will develop invisible cloak using OpenCV using which you will become invisible.

About Invisible Cloak Project
We will create the invisible cloak using an image processing technique called Color detection and segmentation. In order to make this project, you’ll need a single-color cloth. The cloth should not contain any other color visible. Here we are using a green cloth to develop this python project.
Why single-color cloth?

Because we are using color detection and segmentation techniques. If any other color is visible in our cloak then we have to process the image frame for that color also.

Note:

Cloth color should be unique relative to the background. (i.e. If the cloth is green then the background shouldn’t contain any green color)
In good lighting conditions, it works best.
Try to choose red, green or blue cloth, because these three colors are easier to detect.
Color Detection & Segmentation
So what is Color Detection and Segmentation in Image Processing?

Color detection is a technique where we can detect any color in a given range of HSV color space.

Image segmentation is the process of labeling every pixel in an image, where each pixel having the same label shares certain characteristics.

Project Prerequisites:
Python – 3.x (we used Python 3.7.10 in this project)
Numpy – 1.19.2
OpenCV – 4.5
To install opencv, run the below command. Numpy will be automatically installed.
